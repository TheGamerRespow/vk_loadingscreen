# vk_loadingscreen

**What is special with this script ?**
This script is modular and configurable without modifying the HTML and CSS. JavaScript handles everything for you, from to logo to even the color of the page. You can show or hide container, you can choose to put a music or not, there are 24 options to configure. You can translate it easily. It even shows the players count of your server on the loading screen !

**How to install it ?**
Seriously ? Just copy the _vk_loadingscreen_ folder to your _resources_ folder and add `start vk_loadingscreen` to your _server.cfg_.

**How to configure it ?**
There's a file named _config.js_. You juste have to modify this one, don't touch the other ones. And if you mess up the _config.js_ just copy the content of  _base_config.js_ to _config.js_ to reset the configuration.
